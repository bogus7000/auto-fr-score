    "bassAccuracyDescription": "The bass of the QuietComfort 20 is good. LFE (low-frequency extension) is at 21Hz, which is great, meaning they can produce very deep thump and rumbles. However, the entire bass range is consistently above our neutral target by more than 4dB. This makes the overall bass of the QC20 excessively heavy, which sounds boomy and drowns out vocals and other instruments in the mid-range.",
    "midAccuracyScore": 7.7,
    "midAccuracyDescription": "The Bose QC 20 has a mid-range performance. Low-mid is overemphasized by more than 3dB, which is the continuation of the bass overemphasis. This thickens the vocals and makes the mid-range sound cluttered and muddy. Additionally, the dip/recess centering 800Hz pushes vocals/leads slightly to the back of the mix, by giving more emphasis to the bass and treble frequencies.",
    "trebleAccuracyScore": 8.3,
    "trebleAccuracyDescription": "The QC 20 has sub-par treble range performance. The response throughout the range is rather inconsistent. Low-treble is above our target by more than 2dB, bringing emphasis and projection to the upper harmonics of vocals and lead instruments, and giving a subtle V shape to the overall frequency response. The inconsistencies in mid-treble will make the production of sibilances (S and Ts) rather uneven. Additionally, the lacking high-treble means their sound headphones will lack airiness and brilliance."

The headphones underemphasize key frequencies, contributing to a warmer, less clear treble sound than our target.

You'll hear the rumble of sub-bass synthesizers in songs like Them Changes by Thundercat and substantial boom on the attack of his bass guitar. This sound ventures into bloated territory on busy mixes.",
    "midAccuracyScore": 7.8,
    "midAccuracyDescription": "Their mid accuracy is overall good. The low-mid is noticeably louder than the rest of the region, which otherwise reproduces lead instruments well. The low-mid carries on from the exaggerated high-bass region, leading to a boxier sound. However, higher in the mid-range, the buds sound slightly uneven. A noticeable bump in the right earbud in the mid-mid and high-mid produces louder lead instruments and pushes them forward in the mix. This gives the impression that the stereo image is off-center in those mid-frequencies and more present in the right earbud.",
    "trebleAccuracyScore": 8,
    "trebleAccuracyDescription": "Their treble accuracy is great. These in-ear headphones produce a bright top-end with moderately exaggerated vocal clarity and detail. A narrow peak in the mid-treble adds shrillness to the harmonic content of cymbals, which can lead to ear fatigue."

    "trebleAccuracyDescription": "Their treble accuracy is sub-par. Through most of the low-treble, the headphones sound fairly even but under-emphasized. The dip that bottoms out in the mid-treble dulls the details of cymbals and diminishes the harmonic content in vocals. The peak towards the high end of the mid-treble adds some airiness to the headphones' tuning, but it's a not very balanced-sounding treble overall."

While the response never deviates greatly from our target curve, there are some inconsistencies across the entire range. There's some roll-off in the low-treble range that robs vocals and lead instruments of some detail and nuance. The mid-treble response is also quite slanted, so the bottom part of the range is recessed, resulting in lispy-sounding sibilants. However, the top part of this range is overemphasized, adding some zing and attack to acoustic guitar picking and the bells of ride cymbals.

There's also a peak in the mid-mid that can help bring out the detail in dialogue-heavy cutscenes.

    "trebleAccuracyScore": 5.7,
    "trebleAccuracyDescription": "The treble accuracy is disappointing. The response is inconsistent across the entire range. The low treble is very veiled, resulting in a loss of definition in the upper harmonics of vocals. This extends to the lower part of the mid-mid, after which the response peaks. As a result, lower-pitched sibilants, like S and T sounds, can sound dull and lispy, but higher-pitched sounds, like cymbals, can be bright and piercing."
